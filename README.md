# Assessment Process

## Tools Used:

* Visual Studio for Mac (with built in code analysis)
* .NET Core
* C# version included in Visual Studio for Mac
* NuGet packages for Selenium (and associated helper packages), ChromeDriver (to ease running the tests - in a standard dev environment, this would probably be put in a known location)
